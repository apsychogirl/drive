## Before Using : 
1. Make sure git or whatever VCS you're using is configured properly (SSH keys) and you already have cloned the target repo to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have inotify-tools installed. (if not, Ubuntu users can type : sudo apt-get install inotify-tools) for other Distros : https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools/wiki
3. Make sure you have the correct path of the cloned repo in the script.

## Using the script : 
- Use `./watch.sh` to run it in the foreground
- Use `./watch.sh &` to run it in the background 

## How to stop the script from running in the background
- If you run the script using `./watch.sh`, it will terminate as soon as one presses Ctrl+C or Exits the Terminal Session.


- If you run the script in the background (which is convinient) using `./watch.sh &`

  The Ampersand sign (&) makes it or any process for that matter, to run in the background
  
  Once you're done using the script, it becomes tricky to stop the script. One way is to restart the machine which is easy but not convinient.
  
  Here is the smart method : 
  
  Use `ps aux | grep "watch.sh"`, find the PID of the script and then killing it using `kill PID_of_watch.sh`
  
  After that you'll have to run `ps aux | grep "inotify"`, find the PID of inotify and then killing it using `kill PID_of_inotify`

## One small Caveat
You can't upload files whose induvidual size is larger than 50 MB.
You can upload as many files as needed with smaller induvidual size.
